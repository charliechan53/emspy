# emsPy
A Python Wrapper of EMS API. There is also a R wrapper for EMS API. If you are interest in the R version, please visit <https://github.build.ge.com/212401522/Rems>. The goal of this project is provide a way to bring EMS data in Python environment via the EMS's RESTful API. The project is still in an early alpha stage, so is not guarranteed working reliably nor well documented. I'll beef up the documentation as soon as possible.

Any contribution is welcome!

Dependency: numpy, pandas, networkx

## Installation
Right now, I've not yet packed this into an installation package. Just download or clone emsPy in a local directory and work on there. I'll make it as an installable package soon.

## Make an EMS API Connection

The optional proxy setting can be passed to the EMS connection object with the following format:
```python
proxies = {
    'http': 'http://{prxy_usrname}:{prxy_password}@{proxy_server_address}:{port},
    'https': 'https://{prxy_usrname}:{prxy_password}@{proxy_server_address}:{port}'
}
```

```python
from pems import Connection

c = Connection('kyungjin.moon',mysetting.pwd, proxies = proxies)

```

## Instantiate Query 


```python
from pems.query import Query

query = Query(c, ems_name = 'ems9')
```

Current limitations:
- The current query object only support the FDW Flight data source, which seems to be reasonable for POC functionality.
- Right now a Query object can be instantiated only with a single EMS system connection. I think a Query object with multi-EMS connection could be quite useful for data analysts who want to do study pseudo-global patterns.
    - Ex) query = Query(c, ems_name = ['ems9', 'ems10', 'ems11'])
- It does not support querying time-series raw parameters yet. Adding this capability may be the next major goal. 
 


## Write Query

### Select
Let's first go with "select". You can select the EMS data fields by keywords of their names as long as the keyword searches a field. For example, the select method finds you the field "Flight Date (Exact)" by passing three different search approaches:
- Search by a consecutive substring. The method returns a match with the shortest field name if there are multiple match.
    - Ex) "flight date"
- Search by exact name. 
    - Ex) "flight date (exact)"
- Field name keyword along with multiple keywords for the names of upstream field groups. 
    - Ex) ("flight info", "date (exact)")

The keyword is case-insensitive.


```python
query.select("flight date", 
             "customer id", 
             "takeoff valid", 
             "takeoff airport iata code")
```

You need to make a separate select call if you want to add a field with aggregation applied


```python
query.select("P22: Fuel Burned by all Engines during Cruise", aggregate="avg")
```

### Group by & Order by
Similarly, you can pass the grouping and ordering condition:


```python
query.group_by("flight date",
               "customer id",
               "takeoff valid",
               "takeoff airport iata code")

query.order_by("flight date")
# the ascending order is default. You can pass a descending order by optional input:
#     query.order_by("flight date", order="desc")
```

### Filtering
Currently the following conditional operators are supported with respect to the data field types:
- Number: "==", "!=", "<", "<=", ">", ">="
- Discrete: "==", "!=", "in", "not in" (Filtering condition made with value, not discrete integer key)
- Boolean: "==", "!="
- String: "==", "!=", "in", "not in"

Following is the example:


```python
query.filter("'flight date' >= '2016-1-1'")
query.filter("'takeoff valid' == True")
# Discrete field filtering is pretty much the same as string filtering.
query.filter("'customer id' in ['CQH','EVA']") 
query.filter("'takeoff airport iata code' == 'KUL'")
```

The current filter method has the following limitation:
- Single filtering condition for each filter method call
- Each filtering condition is combined only by "AND" relationship
- The field keyword must be at left-hand side of a conditional expression
- No support of NULL value filtering, which is being worked on now
- The datetime condition should be only with the ISO8601 format

### ETC.
You can pass additional attributes supported by EMS query:


```python
# Returns only the distinct rows. Turned on as default
query.distinct(True)

# EMS allows max. 5000 of the rows for the output table. Default is 10. 
query.get_top(5000)

# This turns on or off the "display" format of the output. It is turned on as default
query.readable_output(True)

```

### Viewing JSON Translation of Your Query
You can check on the resulting JSON string of the translated query using the following method calls.


```python
# Returns JSON string
# print query.in_json()

# View in Python's native Dictionary form 
from pprint import pprint # This gives you a prettier print

print("\n")
pprint(query.in_dict())
```

                          'value': {'args': [{'type': 'field',

## Run Query and Retrieve Data
You can finally send the query to the EMS system and get the data. The output data is returned in Pandas' DataFrame object.



```python
df = query.run()

from IPython.display import display
display(df)
# This will return your data in Pandas dataframe format
```
